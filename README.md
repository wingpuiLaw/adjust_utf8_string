# adjust_utf8_string
This project may be called code better and can be adjusted to the end of the string encoded in utf8 (65001).   
The reason I wrote this code is that the string I used before was truncated when I got the data from mysql.

## file structrue
- adjust_utf8_string.c     # only one file about the project
