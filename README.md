# Cut the tail of Unicode in UTF-8
This project may be called code better and can be adjusted to the end of the string encoded in utf8 for unicode.   
The reason I wrote this code is that the string I used before was truncated when I got the data from mysql.

## file structrue
- cutTailofUnicodeinUtf8.c     # only one file and one function in this project
